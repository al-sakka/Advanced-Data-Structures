# Data Structures Learning Application for Kids

An educational application designed to help kids learn and interact with various data structures through a user-friendly interface.


## Introduction
This application is designed to teach kids about different data structures and how they are implemented in C++. Users can easily switch between data structures and perform various operations on them. The project includes implementations of AVL Tree, Binary Search Tree (BS Tree), Circular Queue, Dynamic Queue, Dynamic Stack, Linked List, and Static Stack.

## Features
- Interactive console interface for learning data structures
- Operations on Linked List, Stack, Queue, and Tree
- Easy to switch between different data structures
- User-friendly prompts and instructions

## Installation
To install and run this application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/al-sakka/Advanced-Data-Structures
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd datastructures-learning-app
   ```
3. Compile the project:
   ```sh
   g++ -o DataStructuresApp main.cpp functions.cpp UX.cpp -Iincludes
   ```

## Usage
To run the application, use the following command:
```sh
./DataStructuresApp
```

You will be presented with a menu to choose from various data structures. Follow the prompts to perform operations on the selected data structure.

## Data Structures
### Linked List
- Insert at the end
- Insert at the start
- Insert at a specific index
- Get data from a specific index
- Delete from the end
- Delete from the start
- Delete a specific node
- Get size
- Print all data
- Clear the list

### Stack (Dynamic)
- Push
- Pop
- Peek
- Print all data
- Get size
- Clear
- Swap elements
